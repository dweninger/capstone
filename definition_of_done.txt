==============================

This is Daniel's definition of done for agile programming and scrum purposes.
If a part of the project does not meet one of the criteria listed,
it is not considered done for that category.

1) Development
 > Product works as intended via the product owner's specifications
 > There are no major bugs impeding the happy path of the project
 > All functional tests pass

2) For Review
 > Everything in the Development category and...
 > The product is approved by both the product owner and the project advisor.
 > All code is pushed to the respective Git repository and therefore published.
 > The product is user friendly (able to resonably be used by any user of
	the intended audience).

3) Testing/QA
 > Everything in the For Review category and...
 > All foreseen paths of the project work as intended with 
	error handing in place where needed.
 > All bugs are either closed or postponed.
 > Full documentation is written about the product.
 > Performance tests have passing results.
